      <description>Preamble - about myself For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know me, I come from a extreme Sysop background. For more than ten years, I&amp;rsquo;ve strayed away of the developer world problems, focusing on automation of regular infrastructure and other user-directed services. For the last years, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thrown on the eye of the hurricane that is the new agile aplication deployment and Devops world - thus becoming the senior sysadmin of the most insane, multipurpose Kubernetes-as-a-PaaS solution ever developed.</description>

      <description>Task at hand: create a bucket policy that makes an entire bucket public.
Resources used: AWS S3, custom domain registered.
 So I created a website and hosted it on AWS S3. It worked just as advertised, which is nice, even though it could use a &amp;lsquo;press one button and be done with it&amp;rsquo; just as their one-click-shop.
As noticed, I had to Grant public read access to all objects on upload.</description>

      <description>Task at hand: host a static website on a S3 bucket. URL for the website will be: yellatcloud.devsres.com
Resources used: AWS S3, custom domain registered.
 Two of the most repeated sentences on the Linkedin Learning AWS Courses I&amp;rsquo;ve met are:
 AWS S3 (the object storage service) - is the most widely used Amazon service ever; One can host static websites on AWS S3 trivially.  Is that so? Let&amp;rsquo;s check.</description>

      <description>Task at hand: implement HTTPS to a static website hosted on S3
Resources used: AWS S3, AWS CloudFront
 So I created a website and hosted it on AWS S3. But no HTTPS! That&amp;rsquo;s so old-fashioned.
Cloudfront Work in Progress!
 Reference: AWS Cloudfront.
