      <description>Note for Pros: Terraform noob tip. It&amp;rsquo;s not that relevant.
Preamble I had a turbulent mission: learn both Terraform and AWS from scratch without ever using it before, building a full EKS cluster as IaaC. I also had two weeks.
So, as expected, it was a hurricane of copy and paste from examples in the Internet - mainly official Terraform documentation - and methodology was &amp;ldquo;if it&amp;rsquo;s created, it&amp;rsquo;s fine!&amp;quot;.</description>
