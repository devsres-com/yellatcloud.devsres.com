      <description>Task at hand: create a bucket policy that makes an entire bucket public.
Resources used: AWS S3, custom domain registered.
 So I created a website and hosted it on AWS S3. It worked just as advertised, which is nice, even though it could use a &amp;lsquo;press one button and be done with it&amp;rsquo; just as their one-click-shop.
As noticed, I had to Grant public read access to all objects on upload.</description>
